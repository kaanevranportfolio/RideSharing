  - Price estimates and fare breakdowns
  - Real-time pricing updates

- **GeospatialService** (`shared/proto/geo/geo.proto`)
  - Distance and ETA calculations
  - Route optimization
  - Geospatial queries

### 2. gRPC Client Manager

**Key Features:**
- **Connection Management**: Automatic connection pooling with keepalive
- **Health Monitoring**: Real-time connection health checks
- **Service Discovery**: Configurable service endpoints
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues operation when services are unavailable
- **Timeout Management**: Per-service timeout configuration
- **Reconnection Logic**: Automatic reconnection on connection failures

**Architecture:**
```go
type ClientManager struct {
    GeoClient      geopb.GeospatialServiceClient
    UserClient     userpb.UserServiceClient
    TripClient     trippb.TripServiceClient
    MatchingClient matchingpb.MatchingServiceClient
    PricingClient  pricingpb.PricingServiceClient
    PaymentClient  paymentpb.PaymentServiceClient
    // Connection management and health monitoring
}
```

### 3. API Gateway Architecture

**HTTP Server Features:**
- **RESTful API**: `/api/v1/*` endpoints for all operations
- **Health Monitoring**: `/health` and `/status` endpoints
- **WebSocket Support**: Real-time communication at `/ws`
- **CORS Support**: Cross-origin resource sharing enabled
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Proper cleanup on termination

**Endpoints Implemented:**
- `GET /health` - Overall system health
- `GET /status` - Individual service connection status
- `GET /api/v1/users/{id}` - User information
- `GET /api/v1/trips/{id}` - Trip details
- `POST /api/v1/pricing/estimate` - Price estimation
- `POST /api/v1/matching/nearby-drivers` - Driver discovery
- `POST /api/v1/payments` - Payment processing

### 4. GraphQL Schema

**Complete Type System:**
- **User Types**: User, Driver profiles with comprehensive fields
- **Trip Types**: Trip lifecycle with status tracking
- **Payment Types**: Payment processing with method management
- **Location Types**: Geospatial data with address information
- **Analytics Types**: Business intelligence and reporting

**Operations Supported:**
- **Queries**: Data retrieval across all services
- **Mutations**: Create, update, delete operations
- **Subscriptions**: Real-time updates for trips, drivers, pricing
