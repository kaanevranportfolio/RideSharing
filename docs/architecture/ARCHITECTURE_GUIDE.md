## 🎯 High-Level Overview

**What is this project?**
This is a **production-grade rideshare platform** (like Uber/Lyft) built using modern microservices architecture. Think of it as a complete backend system that handles everything from user registration to payment processing for ride-sharing.

**Main Business Flow:**
1. 👤 **Rider** opens app, requests a ride
2. 🎯 **System** finds nearby available drivers
3. 🚗 **Driver** gets matched and accepts ride
4. 📍 **Real-time tracking** during the trip
5. 💰 **Payment** processing when trip completes

  - Rate limiting and security
  - Real-time subscriptions (WebSocket)

**Think of it as:** The reception desk that directs visitors to the right department

### **2. User Service** 👤
**Purpose:** Manages all user-related operations
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Responsibilities:**
  - User registration/login
  - Profile management (riders & drivers)
  - Authentication tokens
  - Driver verification and documents

**Key Models:**
- `User` (basic info, email, phone)
- `Driver` (license, ratings, vehicle association)

### **3. Vehicle Service** 🚗
**Purpose:** Manages vehicle information and availability
- **Database:** PostgreSQL
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Vehicle registration
  - Vehicle types (economy, premium, luxury)
  - Availability status
  - Vehicle-driver associations

### **4. Geo Service** 📍

**Why MongoDB?** Excellent for geospatial queries and location indexing

### **5. Matching Service** 🎯
**Purpose:** The brain of the operation - matches riders with drivers
- **Technology:** Complex algorithms with Redis caching
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Find nearby available drivers
  - Score drivers based on multiple factors:
    - Distance (40% weight)
    - Rating (30% weight)  
    - Availability (20% weight)
    - Vehicle type match (10% weight)
  - Apply fairness algorithms
  - Handle driver reservations

**This is the most complex service** - like a sophisticated matchmaking algorithm

### **6. Pricing Service** 💰

  - Surge pricing (supply vs demand)
  - Promotions and discounts
  - Different vehicle type pricing
  - Real-time price updates

### **7. Trip Service** 🛣️
**Purpose:** Manages the entire trip lifecycle
- **Technology:** Event sourcing pattern
- **Responsibilities:**
  - Trip creation and state management
  - Trip status updates (requested → matched → in-progress → completed)
  - Event history for audit trails
  - Integration with all other services

**Trip States:**
```
Requested → Driver Assigned → Started → In Progress → Completed/Cancelled
```

### **8. Payment Service** 💳
**Purpose:** Handles all payment operations

- **Responsibilities:**
  - Payment processing
  - Fraud detection
  - Refunds and chargebacks
  - Multiple payment methods
  - PCI compliance

## 🔄 Data Flow & Interactions

### **Typical Ride Request Flow:**

1. **🏁 Ride Request**
   ```
   Mobile App → API Gateway → Trip Service
   ```
   - User requests ride with pickup/destination
   - Trip Service creates new trip record

2. **🔍 Driver Matching**
   ```
   Trip Service → Matching Service → Geo Service
   ```
   - Matching Service finds nearby drivers
   - Geo Service calculates distances
   - Best driver gets selected and reserved

3. **💰 Pricing Calculation**
   ```
   Trip Service → Pricing Service
   ```
   - Calculate base fare + surge pricing
   - Apply any promotions/discounts

4. **📱 Real-time Updates**
   ```
   Any Service → API Gateway → WebSocket → Mobile App
   ```
   - Driver location updates
   - Trip status changes
   - ETA updates

5. **💳 Payment Processing**
   ```
   Trip Service → Payment Service
   ```
   - Process payment when trip completes
   - Handle fraud detection
   - Send receipts

### **Inter-Service Communication:**
- **gRPC:** For fast, typed communication between services
- **Redis Pub/Sub:** For real-time events and notifications
- **Database:** Each service has its own database (database per service pattern)
