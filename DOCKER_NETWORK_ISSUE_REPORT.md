# !!!!!! DOCKER NETWORK HOSTNAME ISSUE REPORT !!!!!!

## SUMMARY
- TEST SCRIPTS AND SERVICES EXPERIENCE HOSTNAME RESOLUTION ISSUES BETWEEN LOCALHOST AND DOCKER SERVICE NAMES.
- INSIDE DOCKER COMPOSE NETWORK, SERVICES MUST USE INTERNAL SERVICE NAMES (E.G., `API-GATEWAY:8080`).
- SCRIPTS OR TESTS RUNNING ON HOST MACHINE MUST USE `LOCALHOST:8080` OR MAPPED PORTS.
- RUNNING TESTS OUTSIDE DOCKER CAUSES FAILURES DUE TO HOSTNAME MISMATCH.

## ROOT CAUSE
- DOCKER INTERNAL DNS RESOLVES SERVICE NAMES ONLY INSIDE THE NETWORK.
- HOST MACHINE CANNOT RESOLVE DOCKER SERVICE NAMES.
- ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES AND SCRIPTS MAY DEFAULT TO `LOCALHOST`, CAUSING INTEGRATION FAILURES.

## BEST PRACTICE
- ALWAYS RUN INTEGRATION AND E2E TESTS INSIDE A DEDICATED TEST CONTAINER WITHIN THE DOCKER COMPOSE NETWORK.
- USE SERVICE NAMES FOR ALL INTERNAL COMMUNICATION.
- USE `LOCALHOST` ONLY FOR HOST-TO-CONTAINER ACCESS.

## ACTION ITEMS
- ADD A TEST-RUNNER CONTAINER TO `DOCKER-COMPOSE-TEST.YML`.
- UPDATE TEST SCRIPTS TO USE SERVICE NAMES FOR INTERNAL CALLS.
- DOCUMENT THIS NETWORKING BEHAVIOR FOR ALL DEVELOPERS.
