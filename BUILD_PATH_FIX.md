# Build Path Resolution Fix

## Problem
Services were experiencing EOF errors during build due to Go module path resolution conflicts.

## Root Cause
- Services without individual `go.mod` files were trying to use the root module
- Building from service directories caused file path resolution issues
- Go couldn't locate source files in the expected module structure

## Solution
Each service now has its own `go.mod` file with:
```go
module github.com/rideshare-platform/services/SERVICE-NAME

go 1.21

replace github.com/rideshare-platform/shared => ../../shared

require (
    github.com/gin-gonic/gin v1.9.1
    github.com/rideshare-platform/shared v0.0.0-00010101000000-000000000000
)
```

## Current Status
✅ Geo Service - has go.mod, builds successfully  
✅ Matching Service - has go.mod, builds successfully  
✅ Trip Service - has go.mod, builds successfully  
⚠️ Vehicle Service - has go.mod, dependency issues  
⚠️ User Service - has go.mod, file corruption issues  

## Build Instructions
```bash
# From root directory
make build

# Individual service (from service directory)
cd services/SERVICE-NAME
go build -o bin/SERVICE-NAME .
```
