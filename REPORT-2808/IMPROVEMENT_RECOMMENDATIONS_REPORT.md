    Status TripStatus `json:"status"`
    // Event sourcing foundation is there
}
```

**Required Implementation:**

    case TripStatusStarted:
        return t.startTrip(context.StartLocation)
    case TripStatusCompleted:
        return t.completeTrip(context.EndLocation, context.FinalFare)
    }
    
    // Create event for event sourcing
    event := t.createStateChangeEvent(t.Status, newStatus, context)
    return t.applyEvent(event)
}

// Event sourcing replay capability
func (t *Trip) ReplayEvents(events []TripEvent) error {
